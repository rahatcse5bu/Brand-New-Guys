**Case Study: An elevated communal dining Experience for Breitling, Bar Berta, and  Your Favourite Ancestor**

**Client Overview**

This collaboration brought together three distinct yet complementary brands: Breitling, Bar Berta, and "Your Favourite Ancestor," an initiative by actress and cultural activist Yootha Wong-Loi-Sing. Breitling, a Swiss luxury watch brand known for its precision and timeless designs, embodies a commitment to craftsmanship and heritage. Bar Berta, a culinary space celebrated for its emphasis on abundance and community, offers a rich, immersive dining experience. Yootha Wong-Loi-Sing’s "Your Favourite Ancestor" is a creative platform that honors cultural heritage, celebrating the legacies of the past while empowering the present.

> The goal of this collaboration was to design an exclusive dinner experience that would seamlessly integrate the values of these three brands—timelessness, abundance, and respect for heritage—into a cohesive narrative that resonated deeply with the guests.

**The Challenge**

The key challenge was to create a singular, immersive experience that would highlight the overlapping brand values of timelessness, abundance, and respect for heritage. The experience needed to resonate with a diverse group of attendees, from Breitling's luxury watch aficionados to Bar Berta's culinary enthusiasts, and those who are inspired by the cultural empowerment ethos of "Your Favourite Ancestor."

It was essential that every element of the event, from the digital invitation to the aftermovie, aligned with the overarching theme and left a lasting impression on all guests.

**Our Approach**

Our approach was to build a holistic experience where every touchpoint reinforced the core values of the brands involved. We aimed to create a journey that began with the first contact and extended beyond the event itself, ensuring that all "gears" of the experience worked towards the same goal.

**Concept Development:**
The theme "Time will Tell" became the foundation of our concept. This idea celebrated the contributions of each attendee to society and life, recognizing their unique impact just as the involved brands cherish and preserve their respective legacies. This theme seamlessly aligned with Breitling’s focus on timelessness, Bar Berta’s celebration of abundance, and "Your Favourite Ancestor’s" dedication to honoring heritage.


**Digital Invitation Experience:**
We crafted a digital invitation that was more than just an event announcement—it was an experience in itself. Guests received personalized invitations that illustrated their first name in 3D flowers, making them feel valued and recognized even before the event. The digital invite was interactive, allowing guests to rotate, zoom in and out of their names, adding a touch of sophistication and production value.


**Event Design:**
The dinner took place at Gaea Studios, where the space was transformed to reflect the synergy between the three brands. The setting featured carefully curated decor by Yoko Negi, that combined elements of luxury, heritage, and floral abundance. For example, the tables were adorned with vintage-inspired floral arrangements that symbolized both the timeless elegance of Breitling and the rich cultural legacies honored by "Your Favourite Ancestor." Sonically the evening was curated by turntablist Adison dos Reis and enriched with exquisite soundscapes by harpist Rani Ribeiro.

Each course of the meal was designed to tell a story, with dishes inspired by both traditional recipes and modern culinary techniques, reflecting Bar Berta’s philosophy of abundant, communal dining. The menu also included subtle nods to Breitling’s heritage and "Your Favourite Ancestor’s" cultural narratives, creating a truly immersive experience.

**Event Experience:**
During the dinner, guests were invited to engage in conversations about time, heritage, legacy and the ways in which they themselves contribute to the continuation of these values. A key moment of the evening was a toast led by Yootha Wong-Loi-Sing, who spoke about the importance of honoring our ancestors and how each guest is a living testament to those who came before them.

> The evening also featured a showcase of Breitling’s latest collection, presented in a way that highlighted the craftsmanship and timeless quality of the brand, seamlessly integrating it into the event's broader narrative.

Post-event, guests received a personalized thank-you note and a link to the aftermovie, along with exclusive content that deepened their connection to the three brands. This final touch ensured that the experience lived on, reinforcing the themes long after the dinner concluded.

**Results**

The dinner experience was a resounding success, achieving the goal of creating a synergistic event that highlighted the overlapping values of Breitling, Bar Berta, and "Your Favourite Ancestor." Guests left with a profound sense of connection not only to the brands but also to each other, having shared an experience that celebrated their contributions to society and heritage.

The personalized approach, from the digital invite to the aftermovie, created a strong emotional resonance with the guests, many of whom shared their experiences on social media, further amplifying the reach of the event.

> The visuals also served as a powerful marketing tool, encapsulating the essence of the collaboration and driving continued engagement with all three brands.

**Conclusion**

This case study illustrates the power of a well-crafted, synergistic event experience in creating deep, meaningful connections between brands and their audiences. By focusing on shared values—timelessness, abundance, and respect for heritage—and ensuring that every element of the event was aligned with these themes, we were able to create an unforgettable experience that not only met but exceeded the expectations of all involved. This collaboration stands as a testament to the potential of cross-brand partnerships in crafting unique and impactful narratives.
